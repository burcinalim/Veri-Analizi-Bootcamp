# COVID-19 Impact Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 using statistical methods and data visualizations. It provides insights into the spread, recovery rates, and mortality rates associated with the pandemic across different regions.


## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Indentify top 10 countries by total number of cases,
- Total Death Count Based On WHO Region,
- Visualization of Deaths / 100 Cases, Recovered / 100 Cases, Deaths / 100 Recovered,
- Active Cases by Region,
- Confirmed vs Deaths
- Provide actionable insights based on the data.

## 🧮 Dataset Summary

- **Total Records:** 187 
- **Total Features:** 15  
- **Data Types:** Numerical and categorical  

## 🔧 Analysis Steps

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning 
Missing values were analyzed.

### 2. 📦 Outlier Detection
Outliers were identified using boxplots.
No extreme outliers were removed due to their relevance.

### 3. 📊 Visualization
Data was visualized using boxplots,scatterplot, and bar charts,.


## 📈 Key Findings

- **Top 10 countries by total number of cases:**  
  - US,Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Chile, United Kingdom, Iran

- **Total Death by Region:**  
  - Americas: 342732
  - Europe: 211144
  - Eastern Mediterranean: 38339
  - South-East Asia: 41349
  - Africa: 12223
  - Western Pasific: 8249
  

## 💡 Observations

- Countries with higher confirmed cases tend to also have high death counts, suggesting that testing and reporting capabilities strongly affect totals.
- WHO regional trends show distinct patterns — some with high case loads but low fatality (e.g., Western Pacific), and others with the opposite.
- A few countries have disproportionately high fatality rates, possibly due to limited healthcare access or overwhelmed systems.
